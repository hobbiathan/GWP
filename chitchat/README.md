# Go ChitChat

The way this book approaches web programming with Go is a little unique; Chapter two is technically a functioning forum application, however it prefaces the chapter by stating that it's completely normal to be intimidated by this chapter, and that the chapters following it will go on to explain more of the functionality and underlying mechanics of the program; really, chapter 2 is just building out a program without actually understanding it completely, so I'll come back to this application later.
